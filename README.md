# Description

paPAML simplifies, amplifies, and accelerates selection analyses via parallel processing, including detection of negatively selected sites. paPAML compiles results of site, branch, and branch-site models and detects site-specific negative selection with the output of a codon list labelling significance values. The tool simplifies selection analyses for casual and inexperienced users and accelerates computing speeds up to the number of allocated computer threads

# Installation

## FreeBSD (Version 13.*)

The operating system for which paPAML was first developed and tested for was FreeBSD. The installation on this OS is very simple - you don't need any conda environment, all the needed packages are available in the system repositories. As root (or using sudo), install the following packages with the command:

    # pkg install wget paml hyphy p5-Proc-ProcessTable p5-Statistics-Distributions p5-File-Which

Now you can either (1) download paPAML.pl as a "normal" user directly from this github repository and place it wherever you like (best option might be your home directory $HOME/bin). If possible adjust the PATH environment to the directory where you put paPAML.pl into (though this is optional, it letâ€™s you access paPAML easier). Or (2) use the following, potentially easier step:

    # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RetroWWU/paPAML/main/paPAML.pl
    # chmod u+x paPAML.pl

and place the extracted directory in your home directory $HOME/bin or another target directory.

    # mkdir $HOME/bin
    # mv paPAML.pl $HOME/bin

That's it!

## Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)

In pricipal the installation is the same on Linux. First install the following packages as root (or using sudo):

    # apt update
    # apt install hyphy-common hyphy-pt paml libfile-which-perl libproc-processtable-perl libstatistics-distributions-perl

Now you can again either (1) download paPAML.pl as a "normal" user directly from this github repository and place it wherever you like (best option might be your home directory $HOME/bin). Additionally it would be good to adjust the PATH environment to the directory where you put paPAML.pl into. Or (2) use the following potentially easier step:

    # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RetroWWU/paPAML/main/paPAML.pl
    # chmod u+x paPAML.pl

and place the extracted directory in your home directory $HOME/bin or another target directory. 

    # mkdir $HOME/bin
    # mv paPAML.pl $HOME/bin

Unfortunately binaries in Ubuntu (like /usr/bin/codeml and /usr/bin/hyphy) are only wrapper scripts with some standard definitions, which will cause problems. To circumvent this you have to adjust the PATH of the following directories before starting the program:

    # export PATH=/usr/lib/hyphy/bin:/usr/lib/paml/bin:$PATH

Copy-paste the export command into your shell resource file .bashrc to make it permanent.

That's it, too!

# Usage

to get a small help about parameters and usage just type the command itself

    # paPAML.pl
    USAGE
        paPAML.pl -p runs [-f controlfiles] [-t tests] [-s significance] [-d] {codemlparams}
        paPAML.pl -i
        paPAML.pl -c

    VERSION 1.20

    WHERE
        runs         - the number of parallel runs
        ...
